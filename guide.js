"ok, no problem" / "let's me go through your website first"

✅ Always end up with a magic question
eg:

What do you mean by that?

What problems are you hoping to solve with this?

###Don't send a long introduction; it can make you sound like a scammer.

Clients, like you, don't like to read long messages.
The goal is to open the conversation and aim for a reply.
Don't rush, they can know you more based on your profile.

Start with "hi" and a simple question to ensure they read your message.
Sometimes, a simple "hi" can also spark their curiosity.


###He might be a good potential client, but don't rush to make an offer.
Sometimes, you can also make an offer in exchange for something like a testimonial.

💬 (Blue text box)
Normally, I charge $500, but for this project, I'll do it for $300. If you like my work, can you provide a testimonial in return?
