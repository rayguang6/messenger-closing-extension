**The Advanced DM Closing Scripts**

*‘Exactly what to say in your inbox to close high ticket deals in no time, without a call”*

*(sidenote: If you’ve already read the first edition of DM scripts, this one is updated)*

I call these scripts the ‘DM Closing Scripts’ because if you follow this process, you WILL close deals, period.

There’s 3 main stages people go through when they message you. 

Btw sidenote \- what’s better than getting red hot leads that are willing to pay you, actually message YOU, versus the other way around. Nothing, right?

So when they do message you, how do you close them?

To make it easy for you, I’ve broken the formula down into 3 sections.

The 3 C’s.

Connect. Collect. Close.

If there’s a 4th it would be ‘objection handling’, BUT, there’s a way to deal with them BEFORE they ever come up. 

Hear me out on this one.

I’ll walk you through each stage and if you do this correctly, most of the time they won’t even have any objections.

So the first C \- Connect \- what do we do here?

Great question\!

The first step is to \*connect\* with your prospect and understand why they’re reaching out.

There’s a right way and a wrong way of doing this.

The wrong way to connect with someone could look like:

1) Getting too excited \- Nobody likes to buy from a ‘fan-boy’ who’s getting too excited just from someone reaching out, because it shows that you’re not used to working with high level people.

2) Being too lazy \- Barely replying to their messages and not showing that you appreciate them for reaching out and how much you care about actually understanding their needs.

3) Asking too many questions \- This just shows desperation that you’re looking to close the deal as fast as possible so you can pay your rent, when all they’re trying to do is see which of the 14 funnel designers in their inbox they should go with.

I think a big reason why I’ve been able to land 7 and 8 figure clients in the Clickfunnels community when there’s been 50+ other people in the clients inbox is the fact that I do things the opposite way than most.

Think about it.

What’s the first place you typically ‘connect’ with them?

Sometimes it can be them just reaching out to you, and that’s happened a lot for me as well. It’s awesome.

But sometimes they make a post in a fb group and there’s a lot of people commenting asking to ‘PICK ME, PICK ME, PICK ME’.

So immediately I look at that and after shaking my head I go… “what can I do differently?”

So when others ‘connect’ by commenting “PM me, I can help” I comment something along the lines of:

“I’ve built funnels for a lot of the 2CC and 2CCX members here and recently actually finished a funnel for clickfunnels, happy to send over the portfolio if you want? (insert tag)”

When I do that, the person asking for a designer scrolls down the comments and sees the 99% of self-centered people pitching their own stuff \*asking\* for something.

So instead of blending in I offer to provide something.

I ALSO offer to send over something that can make their decision easier, which reduces overwhelm, by letting them see my portfolio of designs (which is exactly what they’re looking for)

I’m also the ONLY person with a comment that ends with a question mark, which invites engagement and they feel like they want to respond.

Once they do, I send them a message.

The message looks something like this:

***“Hey \_\_\_\_\_, happy to send over my portfolio.”*** then click ‘send’.

Cause I want it to be a conversation. 

Not a 2-page ebook.

***“But before I do, let me know what type of funnel you’re looking for so I can send a similar funnel and you can see kinda what that looks like”***

\*pause\*

I now wait for them to message me and do the talking.

I don’t move on to the next question.

I don’t harass their inbox if they don’t get back to me in 15 minutes.

Not even in 5 hours.

Sometimes they’re just busy and they’ll respond the next day. That’s fine.

I am too, as a funnel designer, busy on building funnels and I therefore never let a conversation feel desperate as that would only turn the prospect away feeling like I’m not confident in what I do.

So instead I wait and wait for them to open up and connect with me.

I’ve already done my part to connect.

At this point I’m trying to connect with them where they’re at so I can understand the full picture.

They now go on to tell me about the funnel, the offer and the avatar they’re serving.

If there’s something missing, I go deeper to understand all these parts.

“Ok great, and what price do you sell that at?”

“Awesome, and what is your current conversion rate?”

“Got ya, yeah I think we can def get that higher”

“Yeah for sure, I recently did a similar funnel, let me send that over so you can see what it looked like”

All this does is build connection and trust between us to the point they ask for the price.

You’ll notice they typically ask for the price in the beginning.

Don’t fall for it.

It’s obviously normal but you want to first collect more information before throwing out a price, just like a doctor would ask a patient more questions before ‘prescribing’ a solution.

You build authority, just like most people trust a person in a white jacket with ‘Dr’ in front of their names.

So instead of being the ‘sales person’, become the doctor who identifies their problem and prescribes a solution. Which leads me to the next stage.

Collect.

Collecting the right data can be challenging. (and I’ll get to the actual scripts I’ve used soon)

Especially knowing what questions to ask so you don’t sound stupid when they’re asking for the price.

Another mistake I see lots of people have is they keep selling when the client is ready to be closed. But we’ll get to that soon as well.

So here’s a few questions you wanna ask to collect the right information when they ask for the price.

The client says: “How much do you charge for a funnel build?”

***“Depends what you want included, if you also need an email sequence, or is it just design and copy?”***

The client then says: “Just design and copy, I can do the email sequence myself”

***“Awesome, so normally I would charge $3,5k for a complete funnel build but since you do the email sequence I’ll do it for $2,5k and then you’ll have it live in just 7 days”***

Then you just wait.

Sometimes they say “Sounds good, let’s do it\! What are the next steps?”

Sometimes they say “Ok I’ll think about it and get back to you”

And sometimes they’ll just ghost you for a day or two, and not even reply.

This is where the magic happens. This is the stage where you’ll either make or break the sale.

I’ve had people who ghosted me for 1 week, heck even 2 weeks and they still ended up becoming a client.

You don’t know what they’re going through in their life, or how busy they are, or what bills they’re trying to pay first, or what sales they have coming in next week so they can afford you, or what sales video they need from their video team before they can launch, or what course they’re building out that they think they need to complete before launching, and so on and so on.

My point is, this is where the closing starts.

The 3 stage in the 3 C’s.

So what we’ll do now is we’ll do a few scenarios of actual client conversations that I’ve had and how I turned that into a close using what I call…

The ‘Mirror-Effect’.

I guess you could also call it ‘Empathy Closing’ cause it’s basically making sure they feel 100% understood and safe with the decision they’re about to make so they can pay you knowing that you’ll deliver a great funnel with the information you have.

If you’ve done things right up until this point you’ll be the person who asked more questions and controlled the conversation.

When they tried ghosting you or flipped the script, you respectfully replied and asked them another question to regain control.

It’s not about manipulation, it’s about understanding where they’re at so you can offer the right solution by mirroring what they said they wanted.

Which then leads to you actually building a funnel that reflects that, so win-win scenario.

You’ve connected with them so you know what they’ve tried in the past and you’ve asked enough questions to know what’s not working.

You’re good enough at funnels so you know where the funnel is breaking. (Either design, copy, offer, traffic or follow up)

You now prepare to close the bag with a ‘clarity script’, meaning once you’ve dropped your one-liner they’re 100% clear about what they get, when they get it and what the next steps are.

Think about the overwhelm they had when they had to choose between 472918 different people pitching their inbox.

You now give them a clear plan and you offer to do everything for them.

(Sidenote: Or if you’re a coach or course creator you position your plug-and-play templates, scripts, swipefiles, playbooks etc etc as the hard work you’ve ALREADY DONE for them so that they don’t have to.)

This is how my ‘clarity-closer’ script looks like when they ask the magical question:

“Awesome, what are the next steps?”

***“Sweet so the way it works is I send you the invoice and once that’s taken care of I’ll send you a Funnel Intake Form that collects all the information about your funnel so I have everything in one place and can build your entire funnel from there.”***

***“This allows you to focus on other things while I’m building your funnel and that way I don’t have to bother you going back and forth with things I need.”***

***“Should I see once you’ve filled it out that I’m missing something I’ll reach out but other than that it’s super streamlined and so that’s all I need from you and then I’ll have it done for you in 7 days from now.”***

I’ve never had this NOT work.

It always works.

I tell them what’s next, they understand they have to pay the invoice before I start working and they know that once they pay it I’ll send them a Funnel Intake Form so they don’t even expect an onboarding call.

I think with the last 100 clients I’ve done less than 5 onboarding calls, and that was a while ago.

Instead I use a funnel to onboard them haha.

“But Gusten, what if they don’t pay the invoice?” “What if they ghost me?” “What do I do then?” Well I’m glad you asked, cause we’re going to cover that now.  
So lastly I want to outline different questions you can ask at each stage and then we’ll do a few objection handling cards and follow up hacks.

Sound good?

Good.

**Step 1\) Connect**

*‘How to start the conversation to build authority and credibility”*

1. “Hey \_\_\_\_, thanks for reaching out\!”

   Send.

   “Yeah for sure, tell me a bit more about what funnel you’re looking to get built?”

   “Or what the offer is”

   Short quick messages. This way you keep it cool and conversational.

2. “Awesome, do you have a link to your current site or funnel?”

   This shows you’re actually doing your research.

3. (if they have a link) “Thanks, lemme take a look real quick”

   Then get back to them after:

   “Awesome, looks like you have the copy and offer done already”

   “So just a re-design of this page, or what else are we changing?”

4. (if they don’t have a link) “No worries, I often build funnels from scratch so no problem”

5. “Also, what’s the price point of your offer? Just so I know what funnel type would be best for you”

   Then wait for their reply:

   Then send them an example from your portfolio.

   “Awesome… Here’s an example of a similar page I’ve built.”

6. “Btw have you seen my full portfolio yet?”

   Send.

   “I’m happy to send over some more of our recent funnel designs if you want?”

7. “Awesome, here you go: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_/portfolio”

8. “Lmk if you find a specific funnel you like that you’d want me to model after”

\*\*\* This is typically where you wait for them to message you again. If they don’t, you wait a few hours or to the next day and message them the following\*\*\*

“Hey \_\_\_\_, did you find any funnel you like in the portfolio?”

“Awesome, I can also model after another funnel if we work together.”

Send.

“I usually send over a few examples before I start designing so you can pick a theme you’re 100% happy with”

Send.

“Plus what I can do is include unlimited revisions so we make sure you’re happy with the funnel once it’s done.”

\*\*\* This is typically where they ask for the price\*\*\*

**Step 2\) Collect**

*“Collect info about what they currently have and what they need to position for close”*

9. (client asks for price) “Well it depends a little on what assets you already have that we can use, and what you want included”

10. “Sometimes I just do design and copy, sometimes I do the email sequence as well”

11. “Do you want the email sequence as well or do you already have that?”

12. “The most important parts in my experience is the offer, copy and design so I’m happy to do everything for you start to finish, and then when I’m done you can look at it and tweak the copy if there’s something you want to tweak to fit your industry better?”

13. “Are you using Clickfunnels or what software do you usually use?”

    “I usually use CF so I can just move it over to your account in 1 simple click when it’s done and ready to launch”

    “I can also take care of all the tech stuff for you”

14. Do you have any testimonials or case studies we can use?

15. “Awesome, and then I obviously always optimize it for mobile and everything so it’s live and running in 7 days”

      
    \*\*\* This is typically where they’ll ask again, “awesome, how much is it” and so you only reveal the price when you have enough data\*\*\*

**Step 3\) Close**

*“Give them a great deal and use price anchoring to make it a no-brainer”*

1. “So normally I charge $3,5k including design, copy, tech integrations, mobile optimization and email sequences but what I can do since you already have a site with the foundations I can take 1k off and do $2,500 and have it done and live for you in 7 days from now”

2. **(if the client is ready to move forward)** Sweet so the way it works is I send you the invoice and once that’s taken care of I’ll send you a Funnel Intake Form that collects all the information about your funnel so I have everything in one place and can build your entire funnel from there.”

   “This allows you to focus on other things while I’m building your funnel and that way I don’t have to bother you going back and forth with things I need.”

   \*\*\*THEN WAIT FOR CLIENT TO REPLY BEFORE YOU CLOSE WITH:\*\*\*

   “Should I see once you’ve filled it out that I’m missing something I’ll reach out but other than that it’s super streamlined and so that’s all I need from you and then I’ll have it done for you in 7 days from now.

**Bonus \- Follow Up Hacks**

*“How to follow up and close the sale without being burning your boats”*

\*\*\* This is typically when they’ve asked for your portfolio or price and then ghost\*\*\*

1. (The next day) “Hey \_\_\_\_\_, just checking in to see if you already found someone or if you’re still interested in launching your funnel?”

2. (Client says they were busy) “Yeah no problem, just wanted to make sure I can plan for your funnel so we keep the timeline and get it launched it for you asap”

3. (If they stop replying) “Did you have any other questions I can answer before we get started?”

4. (if they haven’t mentioned when they want it launched yet) “Btw we typically have a 7 day turnaround, is that ok for you or do you need it faster?”

5. (if the price is an issue) “Yeah totally understand, no worries. Would it be helpful if we do a payment plan so it’s only 50% upfront and then 50% in 30 days from now?”

6. (if it takes a few days and they don’t get back to you) “\_\_\_\_(funny gif). I’m back haha”

7. “No hard feelings if you already found a funnel builder, just let me know so I can close this conversation”

8. “Haha no worries, I know you’re busy so I wanted to give you some space but I just finished another funnel so I can get to work on yours now if you want”

9. “Awesome, I’ll send over the invoice and we’ll get started”

10. “Here’s the invoice: \_\_\_\_\_”

11. “Lmk when it’s taken care of and I’ll send over the Funnel Intake Form”

12. “Awesome, got it. Thanks\! Excited to work with you on this\!”

13. “Just went through your input form, I think I have what I need right now. I’ll get to work and if I need anything I’ll reach out.”  
      
    **Bonus \- Questions to Ask Before Closing**  
    *“How to Position Yourself as an Expert by Asking The Right Questions”*

\*\*\*These are the questions that make them feel understood, and confident that you know what you’re talking about. Which automatically leads to them trusting you with thousands of dollars, even if you’re a complete stranger to them. These questions, and your portfolio of course.\*\*\*

- What is the offer and who's it for?

- Do you have other products or services you'd like to upsell on the back-end?

- Do you have an existing site for this offer?

- Are you using Clickfunnels or what software are you using?

- Do you have any testimonials or case studies we can use?

- What are your biggest traffic sources at the moment?

- Do you want me to write the copy for the page as well?

- Do you have any email sequence in place as a follow up?

- Do you want me to set up the tech side as well so it's 100% live?

- Do you have someone on your team to manage & optimize the funnel?

- Would you like me to just build everything start to finish, so it's live in 7-14 days?

  **Bonus \- Scale With Outreach Messages**

*“How to Reach More People, Close More Deals, And Not Feel Pushy Doing It\!”*

You’re about to go to sleep, in bed on your phone, scrolling through social media…

Suddenly you get a random message out of nowhere.

A stranger you’ve never talked to before.

“Hey \_\_, nice to connect with you. I noticed from your profile that you’re into \_\_\_ and so I wanted to reach out and connect. I help \_\_\_\_ get \_\_\_\_, so if that’s something you’re interested in, we could jump on a quick call this week. Does tomorrow or Friday work for you?”

You read the message… but you ignore it.

Kinda like “whoah, take me on a date first would you”

Your gut feeling says this feels a little pushy… almost desperate.

And that’s the truth of today's landscape in the social media space.

So the question then becomes… 

How do you ACTUALLY reach out to people, in a genuine way, without being pushy?

I’m gonna give you a few one liners you can use, but always customize them to each person.

Number 1: Facebook's AI will think you’re a bot if you just copy paste. They’ll ban you.

Number 2: People will think you’re spamming if it’s a long message without any deep thought put into it.

So here’s a few things I’d say to reach out to people in my target audience:

**Outreach: Your First 10 Clients**

1. “Hey (name), I checked out your site at www\_\_\_\_.com and wanted to see if you’d want a free re-design.”

   (You can find their site by checking out their profile links or googling them)

   Then click “send”. Then wait a second, and send the next one. (like a real human)

   “I’m building funnels for people like you in the \_\_\_\_ niche and I’d be happy to design a site for you for free in exchange for a testimonial.”

   Then click “send”.

   “ And only if you love it of course ;) “

   Then wait for an answer. That’s it. 3 messages. No ask. Just give.

   What will end up happening is 1\) they either decline 2\) ignore or 3\) are happy that you reached out and will accept your offer.

   Now… you might be thinking: “Gusten, why free? I wanna make money”

   Great question. You’re only gonna make the first page for free. Kind of like a sample taste to show them how good you are.

   Then, and only once they start asking for additional work, will you give them a custom offer. A paid offer at a reduced rate, and now they turn into a paying client.  
      
   I did this years ago and it turned out he hired me for multiple projects afterwards, as well as referred clients to me for months, totalling over $10,000+ in sales easily for me.

   The key here is to make sure you have a few clients who are happy, not a ton of clients that are semi-happy, or even worse \- super disappointed.

   Once you agree to build something for free, you can use this to get started:

   “Awesome, I’ll send over the regular client onboarding form so you can fill it out and from there I’ll have everything I need to design something great for you.”  
     
   **Outreach: Scaling to 10-50 Clients**

2. “Hey (name), nice to meet you\!”

   Send. Wait a second. Then continue:

   “I’m building out a few funnel templates atm, so wanted to see if you’d want one for free before I start selling them?”

   Send. Wait a second. Then continue:

   “Here’s some examples, just lemme know if you want one and I’ll send it over”

   “No strings attached, just having fun with building these haha”

   Send.

   That’s it. You can now wait for their reply and if they’re interested, you just send them a free funnel template or 2\. 

   “But Gusten, how is that going to make me money?”

   Who cares if you don’t make money from them right away?

   The goal is to build relationships.

   Think of it this way.

   You’ve probably downloaded 10 lead magnets or more over the years.

   How many did you end up buying from?

   Probably not all of them, but most likely 1 or more.

   So the goal is to give so much, that a % of people will naturally want you to build it for them. Specially if you can make the templates look amazing… 

   That’s when you use the DM closing scripts in this playbook to close them.

   “Yeah for sure, happy to discuss pricing and all that good stuff… but first: \_\_\_”  
     
   **Outreach: Fb Group \-\> Messenger**

3. “Hey (name), welcome to the \_\_\_\_ FB group. Great to have you\!”

   Send. Then wait. Then continue:

   “I saw you mentioned in the questions when you joined, that you’re a \_\_\_\_ wanting to learn more about \_\_\_\_”

   “I love sending people a free \_\_\_ (template/playbook/training) when they join the group, so lemme know if that’s something you’d want and I’ll be happy to send it over to you”

   “Again, 100% for free. No optin needed or anything haha”

   Then wait for their reply.

   This one is different than just blatant cold outreach. Since this one is a FB group and people are coming to you (your group) and wanting to learn more already.

   So the key here is to genuinely just want to serve.

   To give them what they’re looking for.

   The community you build, the value you provide, and the no-brainer offers in the group will lead to more inbox conversations, which will automatically lead to more closed deals.

   And yes, this works for done-for-you services too. Not just the coaching or course space. I’m a living example of that.
