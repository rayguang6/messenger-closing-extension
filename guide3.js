 **Outbound edition: DM prospecting on FB, Twitter**  
This script isn’t a one-size-fits-all, conversation should flow organically and naturally, it should be tailored to the individual. I will provide a template to prompt you on how to approach a conversation but it’s your responsibility to fine-tune it.

Let’s have a look at 99% of the conversational structures on **outbound** conversations. For **inbound** conversations, the same structure applies, but the initial start of the conversations will be different, same as for the pre-framing, but it’s not a focus in this training document.

**The structure of (almost) EVERY sales conversation on Facebook** 

Genuine opening / Complimenting

1. Pre-framing / Taking control / Guiding  
2. Education / schooling / awareness  
3. Logistics and conversation (Pre-qualification)  
4. (Pre-) Soft pitch  
5. Offering the call  
6. Dropping the ballpark (optional)  
7. Booking in the meeting  
8. FOLLOW UP

Optional:

9. Ghost / Ignore  
10. Value sharing (resource) / Inviting them into your group

Now that we know the sequence of how our conversation will highly likely flow. We can build a custom script around it. Even though the start approach always differs (initial messages), the general approach can be considered the same.

**Conversation structures on Facebook** 

1. **Genuine opening/complimenting**

First and foremost, always start with the 3-2-1 method to help you get your foot in the door from the previous training.

3 Likes on their profile (banner, profile picture, and a post e.g.), 2 sincere comments on posts related to their work (if recent), 1 sincere opening message. Now to start a new conversation from a new connection from your target audience and avatar, use the following:

*Hey \[name\], It’s great to connect with you. I’m always looking for like-minded people to connect with\! I really enjoyed reading the last post you did about \[X\]\! How’s it going?*

The most important thing here is that we take a genuine interest in the lead and show that we’ve gone over their profile and **compliment them**. 

If they don’t have anything to comment on being creative, what is it that drives their passion and fuels them? If they don’t post anything too often, look at their banners if they are a coach or a consultant, if they are photographers see if they have any amazing photos/creative work you can talk about.

2. **pre-framing / taking control / guiding** 

We as the individual reaching out should always stay in control and pre-frame / guide the prospects in the conversation. But make them tell them your pain points through organically nurturing the conversation, making it seem like you’re a business owner  networking

For example, if we get a response that continues the conversation, we acknowledge what has been said, and start the pre-framing / taking control of the conversation and guide it.

***Example 1\.***

**Lead:** *Thank you\! I’m doing amazing\!*

**Us:** *I’m glad that you’re doing well\! How is your store coming along, Is everything going well in q1,2,3,4 (whatever quarter they’re in), I find that FB is slowing down* 

***Example 2\.***

**Lead:** *Thank you\! I’m doing amazing\!*

**Us:**  *I’m glad that you’re doing well\! I saw your post about \<xyz issues\>, did you manage to get that fixed?*

*side note: This is a very direct approach, you would only use this if they specifically call out their pain point, this signifies they are desperate and a warmer lead. .*

*etc..*

**Take note of how we start talking about what we want to talk about and don’t digress. Make your intentions clear in a non-pushy, non-salesy way.**

During this process of DM’ing people, we constantly do this to stay on track keeping sight of our end goal, getting to talk to these people on a chat or see if we can help them / close them in the DM’s for a call.

Example 2 is pretty direct and we can only be so direct if the cadence of the conversation makes sense also taking into consideration how ‘advanced’ your prospect is with prospecting. For coaches and consultants, for example, this method would be too direct and come across salesy instantly.

**A very important thing is that you always approach this from a giving and inviting perspective. Genuinely be interested in what the lead says/tells you, but don’t digress from your end goal.**

3. **Educating / schooling / awareness**

A lot of prospects you will encounter, are not (actively) aware that they have a problem in the first place, and it’s for us to find out.

Generally speaking, we can talk about 3 levels of pain we can try to uncover with them.

Pain level 1: Surface problem.

- A problem the prospect has right now. E.g. wanting to go from 5, to 10k a month. Very general.


Pain level 2: intermediate problem.

- A problem related to their business that needs to be solved to ‘fix’ pain level one. E.g. I need to understand how to get better at DM selling to close more deals.

Pain level 3: Personal pain point.

- Personal interest related to the pains above. How are they going to benefit from solving this problem on a personal level? E.g. Become financially independent, become free in time, take better care of their family etc.

**Always remember, NO PAIN NO SALE.**

Our only goal straight from the bat is to find out in a **sincere** way, is to see if there is a pain point hurting the prospect deep enough and if our service can fix that for them.

So tracing back to making the prospect aware of the problem with our messages, if we do find it, it is also our duty to then school and educate them on it. 

Let me show you in another example how that is done moving forward with our previous examples:

*example 1\.*

**pre-frame**  
Lead: *Thank you\! I’m doing amazing\!*  
Us: *I’m glad that you’re doing well\! I was looking at your socials and website and noticed that you’ve got some Facebook pixels installed\! It had me wondering, are you currently in the process of trying to obtain more customers?*

Lead: *Yeah\! been doing this for a while now\! Trying to grow indeed..*  
Us: *Cool\! Sounds like you’ve got a bunch of experience already\! Just out of curiosity, how’s that process going so far for you \[smiley\]*

**Educate / school / awareness**  
Lead: *Could be better, but also worse I guess. Just going with the flow of things really.*  
Us: *haha, totally get that. What are you currently trying in regards to scaling? For example, are you using organic or paid methods?*

*Example 2\.*

**pre-frameEducate / school / awareness**

Lead: *Thank you\! I’m doing amazing\!*  
Us: *I’m glad that you’re doing well\! I was looking at your socials and website and noticed that you’ve got some Facebook pixels installed\! It had me wondering, are you currently in the process of trying to obtain more customers?*

Lead: *Yeah, but mostly I’m not doing anything with those pixels.. followed a quick course in the past and left it there. Took me too much time as well to do on the side.*  
   
Us: *Love how you took at least some action to go out there and try it to be honest. But Yeah it’s not easy indeed as a side project. in terms of those new clients, are you solely relying on referrals and inbounds than at the moment?*

Lead*: Yep.*

Us: *So I can imagine that that can be unpredictable most of the time, also from my own experiences, unfortunately. Wouldn’t it be cool if there was a way to get a consistent flow of highly qualified leads for your business each month? \[smiley\]exa*

So granted, all these examples would be ideal situations but it’s merely to show you the flow of it. If you’ve been paying close attention, you can also see how the language is neutral and open. We can never make assumptions about someone or their business on a personal level, but we can make assumptions to pre-frame a problem to see if they resonate with that.

This is not a shot in the dark of course. If we attempt this method and level of DM prospecting we **must** **know** in advance what most of the clients are dealing with in terms of pain points and problems. It doesn’t have to be super in-depth, as long as we know the surface-level pain of the avatar and market are running into frequently.

4. **Logistics and conversation (Pre-qualification)**

Really this is the stage where the conversation happens. If you did the first steps right you and the prospect (highly likely) end up having a conversation about the seed you planted. Important is that you stay neutral in language, be open and inviting, and don’t assume anything about them personally.

use phrases and words like: “Could you be interested in that?”, “Perhaps”, “Does that interest you”, “Could that be something”, “Just out of curiosity”.. etc. 

Also, before we want our prospect to take action, we ASK them.  

E.g. *“ Hey i’ve just prepared a training that could be useful to you in relation to what we’ve talked about in this conversation\! I would love to shoot that over if that interests you\!”*

*VS.*

*“Hey I just made a training, here it is.”*

5. **Ghost and Ignore sequence:**

Throughout your DM game, you will encounter a lot of ghosting and ignoring. Understand that you are still doing sales and constantly interrupting people’s lives. The sales method we use is very open and inviting, so a proper conversation could lead from it, but the majority of the time you’re going to have to follow up with them.

Let’s start with understanding ‘why’ you are following up constantly.

- It’s the highest yielding task in prospecting  
- Doesn’t believe it will work for them  
- loses initial interest (shiny object)  
- Needs a different opportunity (value ladder)  
- Needs more education  
- Got disrupted because of their Day to Day life

Now that we kind of understand the why in a simple frame, let’s get into the ‘how’. There are 2 types of DM follow-up, Basic and ‘advanced’.

Basic:

If a prospect ignores you there is a 4 step system you can follow.

- *“Hey\! Did the above make sense?”, “Are you still interested in \[X\]?”, “Did you run into any problems finding a time slot at your own convenience?”* etc.  
- *“Hey, I wonder if you got my last messages”*  
- *“Potential GIF” (waiting) OR “are my messages getting through?” **(optional)***  
- *“Did I say something wrong?”*

For Myself, If someone does not respond after 4 follow-ups, I leave them alone. Depending on how much of a conversation we had in the past, I might revisit that conversation later, log it into my CRM, and reach out with a “*Hey\! been a good while since we spoke\! How have you been doing?”.* 

*Side note: the time to re-engage would be at minimum 2-3 weeks. Always make the follow up related to the conversation. **See if it fits, don’t just send the sequence.***

**Advanced Follow up:**

Apart from sending messages, there are multiple things you can do to get their attention back. Use your own EQ (emotional intelligence) to see if it’s appropriate for the situation.

-   Tags on posts you think could be useful for them  
- Sending them pieces of training (ASK FIRST, also make it related to their situation)  
- Like something on their profile  
- Comment on their recent posts, like them, start a conversation about it  
- Have the influencer send them Audio messages to build rapport  
- Etc.

**Number 1 follow-up rule: Never follow up for the sake of follow-up. Always make it as relatable to the conversation as possible.**

6. Value sharing / (pre-)soft pitch / offering the call.

Throughout the conversation, we constantly want to be sharing our values where applicable and keep the conversation open and inviting. So keep doing that where you can, to build rapport quickly and show your professionalism regarding the subject, but don’t overdo it. (e.g. Don’t send over more than 2-3 training pieces or spam them with it just to try and get the prospects’ interest or their attention.)

So if you’ve been able to pinpoint the pain point(s), it’s now time to educate the prospect on the solution as well, coming from a standpoint that that solution does NOT have to be your personal mindset wise. We want to build a strong connection by giving them the option constantly. We don’t force anything.

If we take our examples again from the pre-frame section, I will show you how to pre-pitch your soft pitch.

*example 1\.*

**pre-frame**  
Lead: *Thank you\! I’m doing amazing\!*  
Us: *I’m glad that you’re doing well\! I was looking at your profile and noticed that you’re a life coach, love that\! Since I see you’re posting a lot of content, are you currently in the process of growth?*

Lead: *Yeah\! been doing this for a while now\! Trying to scale indeed..*  
Us: *Cool\! Sounds like you’ve got a bunch of experience already\! Just out of curiosity, how’s that process going so far for you \[smiley\]*

Lead: *Well to be fair\! It could be better, I’m not sure how to gain more customers and fail to grow my Facebook group.*

**pre- soft pitch**  
Us: *I see, to be fair I hear this a lot but luckily the solution is most of the time fairly simple as well\! I myself help people just like you, scale their consultancy to the next level with my organic marketing methods and systems in roughly 90 days to help generate at least an extra 4-5 figures a month while making sure your business grows consistently and sustainably\! Could you be interested in hearing more about that?*

What you see above, is the pre-pitch. We talk in ‘sexy’ language to make our introduction to what we do as appealing as possible and related to **their** situation. On most occasions, you will get a *“yes, sure\! I’d love to know more about what you do”\!*

*Example 2\.*

**pre-frame**  
Lead: *Thank you\! I’m doing amazing\!*

Us: *I’m glad that you’re doing well\! I was looking at your socials and website and noticed that you’ve got some Facebook pixels installed\! It had me wondering, are you currently in the process of trying to obtain more customers?*

Lead: *Yeah, but mostly I’m not doing anything with those pixels.. followed a quick course in the past and left it there. Took me too much time as well to do on the side.*

Us: *Love how you took at least some action to go out there and try to be honest. But Yeah it’s not easy indeed as a side project. in terms of those new clients, are you solely relying on referrals and inbounds than at the moment?*

Lead*: Yep.*

**Pre- soft pitch**

Us: *So I can imagine that  that can be unpredictable most of the time, also from my own experiences, unfortunately. Wouldn’t it be cool if there was a way to get a consistent flow of highly qualified leads for your business each month to grow your business in a consistent and scalable way? \[smile\]*

Lead: absolutely\! 

**Crafting the soft pitch**  
So now it’s time to craft the most amazing soft pitch ever. It’s your time to shine. Literally. If they don’t find what you do appealing at this stage, you probably lost the lead due to no longer being interested.

So let’s cover what an amazing soft pitch contains:

- Written in ‘sexy language’  
- How we will help them solve their problem  
- The time frame in how many days/months/years the problem will be solved  
- Some deliverables  
- enforcing language such as “*Sustainable, scalable and predictable”*

Let's build our convo flow further from our pre-soft pitches in the last examples:

*example 1\.*

**pre-frame**  
Lead: *Thank you\! I’m doing amazing\!*  
Us: *I’m glad that you’re doing well\! I was looking at your profile and noticed that you’re a life coach, love that\! Since I see you’re posting a lot of content, are you currently in the process of growth?*

Lead: *Yeah\! I've been doing this for a while now\! Trying to scale indeed..*  
Us: *Cool\! Sounds like you’ve got a bunch of experience already\! Just out of curiosity, how’s that process going so far for you \[smiley\]*

Lead: *Well to be fair\! It could be better, I’m not sure how to gain more customers and fail to grow my Facebook group.*

**pre- soft pitch**

Us: *I see, to be fair I hear this a lot but luckily the solution is most of the time fairly simple as well\! I myself help people just like you, scale their consultancy to the next level with my organic marketing methods and systems in roughly 90 days to help generate at least an extra 4-5 figures a month while making sure your business grows consistently and sustainably\! Could you be interested in hearing more about that?*

Lead: *Yeah for sure, sounds interesting enough\! please do.*

**Soft pitch**

Us: *Awesome\! So this is how it generally works\! I’ll help you grow and scale your course in 90 days adding 4-5 figures a month to your business with our proven organic marketing road map in support with hand-holding like mentoring, daily support on messenger in voice and chat, team building, offer fine-tuning and various QA’s on a weekly basis\!*

*Not only would I be looking to fix the specific problems for your specific business but also make it more predictable, scalable, and consistent because of the power of organic marketing\!* 

*Does that sound like something you could be interested in?*

Lead: *actually it does\! The question that arises is, how much does this go for??*

*Example 2\.*

**pre-frame**  
Lead: *Thank you\! I’m doing amazing\!*

Us: *I’m glad that you’re doing well\! I was looking at your socials and website and noticed that you’ve got some Facebook pixels installed\! It had me wondering, are you currently in the process of trying to obtain more customers?*  
Lead: *Yeah, but mostly I’m not doing anything with those pixels.. followed a quick course in the past and left it there. Took me too much time as well to do on the side.*

Us: *Love how you took at least some action to go out there and try it to be honest. But Yeah it’s not easy indeed as a side project. in terms of those new clients, are you solely relying on referrals and inbounds than at the moment?*

Lead*: Yep.*

**Pre- soft pitch**

Us: *So I can imagine that that can be unpredictable most of the time, also from my own experiences, unfortunately. Wouldn’t it be cool if there was a way to get a consistent flow of highly qualified leads for your business each month to grow your business in a consistent and scalable way? \[smile\]*

Lead: absolutely\! 

**Soft pitch**

Us: *So, in essence of what I do:*

*I help you clarify your offer, build an audience organically without spending money on ads. I help you nurture the audience and validate your course idea. After that, I’ll help you build your sales funnel where you have an option to “pre-sell”. I help you turn your knowledge/content into a tangible online course. And scale from there with paid ads.*  

*It’s a self-paced program with lifetime mentoring from myself\!*

*Does that sound like something you can be interested in?*

Lead: *Wow\! absolutely, so what is this service going to cost roughly?*

7. Dropping the ballpark, Booking in the meeting, Following up\!

So we’ve got their undivided attention, having the lead interested in our service/offer. Awesome\! 

Now for a long time, the consensus was that we should not tell our pricing in the DM’s as it will scare the prospect away. Though I’ve always been a firm believer of honesty and transparency upfront for a lot of reasons, but mostly that I respect not only my own time but the prospect’s time as well. What use would it have if we send them on an actual ‘sales call’, chat for 45 minutes with the closer to get rejected on the price because they literally can’t afford it by a long shot? Nothing. So let’s go over how we can pre-frame our price from the previous examples.

*example 1\.*

**Soft pitch**

Us: *Awesome\! So this is how it generally works\! I’ll help you grow and scale your course in 90 days adding 4-5 figures a month to your business with our proven organic marketing road map in support with hand-holding like mentoring, daily support on messenger in voice and chat, team building, offer fine-tuning and various QA’s on a weekly basis\!*

*Not only would I be looking to fix the specific problems for your specific business but also make it more predictable, scalable, and consistent because of the power of organic marketing\!* 

*Does that sound like something you could be interested in?*

Lead: *actually it does\! the question that arises is, how much does this go for??*

**dropping the ballpark**

Us: *Really good question, haha\! So my services range between $3000-$7000 USD depending on your specific needs. If I could help you generate an extra 4-5 figures a month for your business after or in those 90 days...*

*Would that be worth the investment to you?*

Lead: *Well if you can help me make that in that time frame, absolutely\!* 

**Booking in the call**

Us: *Awesome\! So regardless if you’re interested in becoming a private client or not, I’d love to give you some insights and take you through the process so you can see what it could look like for you personally. Does that sound like something you’d like to do?*

Lead: *Sure, why not\!*

Us: *Cool\! We’re excited to get to know you\! Would you be okay with me sending you my teams booking link then so you can find a time slot at your own convenience?*

*Example 2\.*

**Soft pitch**

Us: *So, in essence of what I do:*

*I help you clarify your offer, build an audience organically without spending money on ads. I help you nurture the audience and validate your course idea. After that, I’ll help you build your sales funnel where you have an option to “pre-sell”. I help you turn your knowledge/content into a tangible online course. And scale from there with paid ads.*  

*It’s a self-paced program with lifetime mentoring from myself\!*

*Does that sound like something you can be interested in?*

Lead: *Wow\! absolutely, so what is this service going to cost roughly?*

**Dropping the ballpark:**

Us: *Good question\! So the price that I am charging for my service is $4997 USD. If I can help you with the entire A-Z process; help you make your business become not only more profitable, but also more predictable, scalable, and consistent, would it be worth the investment to you?*

Lead: *Yea, I think it would…*

**Booking in the call**

Us: *Awesome\! So regardless if you’re interested in becoming a private client or not, I’d love to give you some insights and take you through the process so you can see what it could look like for you personally. Does that sound like something you’d like to do?*

Lead: *Sure, why not\!*

Us: *Cool\! We’re excited to get to know you\! Would you be okay with me sending you my teams booking link then so you can find a time slot at your own convenience?*

**Follow up**

In both examples, the follow-up is the same. A lead might not book in for numerous reasons mentioned above in the follow up section and they all might still apply. 

The first follow-up message that we send is this, if they haven’t scheduled something in with us: 

*“Hey \[name\]\! Did you run into any problems finding a time slot that suits you?”*

After that, we will go into our ‘normal’ follow-up sequence as explained in the follow-up section above.

**the side note:**

Obviously, all the conversations outlined are perfect situations and examples. In the real DM game, you might face objections, more lengthy conversations, questions from the prospect, questions from you, price objections, No interest in knowing the price upfront at all.. etc.  
Though, if done correctly, don’t be surprised to set a full-blown qualified meeting in 5-10 messages back and forth ending up in a one-call close. You don’t always have to tell the price upfront. I generally only do it if they ask, or if I doubt the quality of the lead (third world country e.g.).
